# Meta-Thinking

When corrected, don't just fix the immediate mistake. Ask:

1. **What thinking pattern caused this?** (e.g., giving up too early, not considering alternatives, brute-forcing instead of preprocessing)
2. **Where else might this pattern bite me?** (generalize the lesson)
3. **What would a better default behavior look like?** (create a reusable heuristic)

Examples are powerful but dangerous — a bad example undermines the very point you're making. Always sanity-check: does this example actually demonstrate what I claim? (e.g., don't use a derived value to illustrate when setter side effects are appropriate.)
