# claude-vault

A living knowledge base for Claude Code — patterns, solutions, and inspirations accumulated through real-world problem solving.

## Structure

- **problem-solving/** — Concrete solutions to problems I've encountered. Each entry captures the wrong path, the right path, and the transferable principle.
- **design/** — Software design patterns, trade-offs, and architectural insights.
- **tools/** — CLI tools, workflows, and automation tricks worth remembering.
- **inspiration/** — Ideas, sparks, and half-formed thoughts worth revisiting.
- **scripts/** — Utilities for maintaining this vault (e.g., index generation).

## Index

See [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) for a searchable table of all entries.

## Convention

Each `.md` file starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
